   <h1>🌐 Enterprise Network Design using Cisco Packet Tracer</h1>
    <p>This project simulates a real-world <strong>enterprise/campus network</strong> using <strong>Cisco Packet Tracer</strong>, ideal for institutions such as universities or corporate environments with multiple departments and remote locations.</p>
    
  <h2>🏗️ Project Overview</h2>
    <p>The network is divided into <strong>two main areas</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>🏢 <strong>Main Campus</strong> – Includes multiple departments like Admin, Finance, IT, Business, R&D, Labs, etc.</li>
        <li>🏫 <strong>Small Campus</strong> – A remote campus that connects back to the main network using routing.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>🔧 Features & Configuration</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>✅ <strong>VLAN Configuration</strong> - Each department is assigned a specific VLAN (e.g., VLAN90, VLAN100, etc.) to segment traffic and enhance security.</li>
        <li>✅ <strong>Inter-VLAN Routing</strong> - A multilayer switch is configured to enable communication between VLANs.</li>
        <li>✅ <strong>DHCP Server</strong> - Configured to automatically assign IP addresses to devices in different VLANs.</li>
        <li>✅ <strong>FTP Server & Cloud Simulation</strong> - Added for demonstrating server integration and external connectivity.</li>
        <li>✅ <strong>Subnetting & IP Scheme</strong> - A detailed subnetting plan to manage IP address distribution efficiently.</li>
        <li>✅ <strong>End Devices</strong> - Each department includes PCs, printers, and switches to simulate a realistic working environment.</li>
    </ul>
